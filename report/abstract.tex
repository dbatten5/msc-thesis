Automated or semi-automated birdsong classification plays a key role in a
wide range of important fields, such as ecological surveying, climate modelling,
and birdwatching for pleasure. With a recent surge in popularity of machine
learning techniques and a wealth of of publicly available datasets, these
problems are increasingly being tackled using state-of-the-art machine learning
approaches with better and better results. This work will focus on investigating
and evaluating popular approaches to birdsong classification problems, as well
as experimenting with recent research into wider audio classification problems
and evaluating them in a birdsong context.
