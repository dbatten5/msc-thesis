\section{Hypothesis 1}

Hypothesis 1 (H1) is stated as follows:

\begin{quote}
Explore some of the hyperparameters available during the feature extraction
process. The hypothesis is that using hyperparameter values more suited to
birdsong classification problems will yield a higher classification accuracy.
\end{quote}

H1 was applied to two feature extraction processes that appear in some form
widely in the literature related to birdsong classification: MFCC and GTCC\@.

\subsection{MFCC}

The key parameter under test in this work as mentioned in
Section~\ref{sssec:mfcc} is the \textit{BandEdges} argument. 7 experiments were
devised and evaluated in order to see if any improvements to binary bird
classification models utilising MFCC could be made with adjusted
\textit{BandEdges} arguments. The experiments are listed in
Table~\ref{table:h1_mfcc_experiments}.

\begin{table}[h!t]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
\toprule
Number & Number of bands & Band type & Approximate frequency range (Hz) \\ [0.5ex]
\midrule
1 & 40 & Mel & 133 --- 6864 \\
2 & 40 & Mel & 50 --- $\text{fs}/2$ \\
3 & 80 & Mel & 50 --- $\text{fs}/2$ \\
4 & 40 & Linear & 50 --- $\text{fs}/2$ \\
5 & 40 & Linear & 133 --- 6864 \\
6 & 40 & A-mel & 133 --- 6864 \\
7 & 40 & Mel & 133 --- 10000 \\

\subsubsection{Comments on experiment setup}

In the table, `fs' refers to the frequency sampling rate for a given audio file,
usually 44.1 KHz or 48 KHz. $\text{fs}/2$ is the maximum possible value for the
\textit{BandEdges} argument. `A-mel', short for anti-mel, denotes a set of mel
filterbanks that have been inverted, such that the center frequencies are closer
together at higher frequencies and further apart at lower frequencies. `Linear'
refers to a set of filterbanks that have been spaced linearly on the frequency
scale. This has the effect of transforming the MFCC coefficients to Linear
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCC). The different band types can be
visualized in figure

<figure of the different band types>

The experiment design was motivated as follows:

\begin{itemize}

  \item [Exp 1:] These are the defaults provided with the \texttt{mfcc}
    function and acts as a control experiment.

  \item [Exp 2:] A wider frequency range may be able to make use of the
    higher frequency harmonics produced by most birdsong.

  \item [Exp 3:] A wider frequency range means the bands have a larger bandwidth
    and may lose some distinguishing power. Increasing the number of bands may
    help to alleviate this.

  \item [Exp 4:] Since the human auditory system hasn't evolved specifically to be
    able to distinguish birdsong, it's entirely possible that the mel scale
    isn't the optimum scale to use. A linearly spaced set of filterbanks may
    provide a good generalised attempt at distinguishing birdsong.

  \item [Exp 5:] Similar to Experiment 4 but focused on a frequency range that
    more tightly fits around the dominant frequencies produced by bird
    vocalizations.

  \item [Exp 6:] The anti-mel scale has been used with interesting results in
    human speech recognition through telephones~\cite{lei2009mel}. It offers
    more distinguishing power at higher frequencies, and since birdsong is
    typically produced at higher frequencies than human speech, the anti-mel
    scale may be able to better distinguish birdsong.

  \item [Exp 7:] Similar to Experiment 2 but still focused on the main
    frequencies emitted by birds.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Results}

The results for the AUC and classification accuracy for MFCC can be seen in
Table~\ref{table:hyp1_mfcc} and can be visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:hyp1_mfcc}.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc c|c c}

\midrule
  1 & 0.887 & 0.958 & 0.825 & 0.872 \\
  2 & 0.879 & 0.830 & 0.828 & 0.801 \\
  3 & 0.868 & 0.860 & 0.802 & 0.789 \\
  4 & 0.845 & 0.836 & 0.765 & 0.785 \\
  5 & 0.873 & 0.953 & 0.813 & 0.880 \\

As shown in the table and chart, both evaluation metrics are around their
maximum in the control experiment (Experiment 1). Experiment 5 returns
comparable metrics to the control experiment, with slight improvements made to
the classification accuracy for the RBF model, but a slight reduction in the
AUC\@. The RBF model shows a clear reduction in performance for wider frequency
ranges across both evaluation metrics.
