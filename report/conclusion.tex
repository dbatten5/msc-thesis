In this work we have thoroughly investigated some important parameters when
extracting classic features like MFCC and GTCC\@. We have shown that the
parameters can have a significant effect on the overall classification accuracy
and that the parameter values should be carefully considered for the problem at
hand. During this investigation we have shown that MFCC usually outperforms GTCC
when the sample recordings are clean.

We have also investigated some more complex and modern architectures such as CNN
and RNN and have confirmed that they can easily outperform more classical models
like SVM\@. In doing so we have also proposed a novel method of generating
training and testing samples by combining syllables, the elemental blocks of
birdsong, into sequences. We have also laid the theoretical groundwork for an
alternative form of sequence generation that can be used with CRNN in future work.

The main contribution of this study is the application of MRCG to birdsong
classification. While the results achieved here were less than desirable, it's
unclear whether this is from the model design or the suitability of MRCG with
birdsong as some concessions had to be made to allow for MRCG's significantly
higher dimensionality compared to classic features such as MFCC\@. This could be
verified by testing MRCG with some more complex CNN or CRNN model architectures
on more powerful machines.
